						<h2>02 February 2014 - FedoraCoin announces world first coin mixing feature and beta release.</h2>
					</header>
					<p>We've been keeping it under wraps for a while, but now that it's ready we can finally announce it:</p>
					<p>FedoraCoin now lets you mix coins from within the wallet. Coins that are mixed are completely secure and untraceable, allowing you to make fully anonymous payments to any FedoraCoin address.</p>
					<p>A detailed write-up is available <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=391192.msg4886224#msg4886224">here on BitcoinTalk</a>, information on how to join the beta testing is also available there.</p>
					<p>A full public release will be available in the days ahead.</p>

					<h1>But why?</h1>

				<p>Wondering why should you start using FedoraCoin? Read further to learn more and see what makes FedoraCoin stand out from the crowd.</p>
				<section id="why_what">
					<header>
						<h3>What is FedoraCoin?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						FedoraCoin is an open source, virtual currency similar to Bitcoin.
						As an alternative currency, FedoraCoin uses peer-to-peer technology (where users computers connect with other users to form the network) to allow payments to be made worldwide with zero or low processing fees.
						FedoraCoin is traded directly against the value of other digital currencies, requiring only a small conversion fee when converting to another coin.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since nobody owns or controls FedoraCoin, neither a central authority or a bank, everybody can take part.
						FedoraCoin users never pay bank transfer fees, sending and receiving wealth over the internet securely, instantly and free.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="why_value">
					<header>
						<h3>What gives FedoraCoin value?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>FedoraCoin possesses real world value for a number of different reasons:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>FedoraCoin is a tipping commodity</li>
						<li>FedoraCoin is a vessel for transferring wealth</li>
						<li>FedoraCoin can be used as an investment (At the time of this writing, FedoraCoin is worth $3 million USD and rising)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="why_difference">
					<header>
						<h3>What's so different about FedoraCoin?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						FedoraCoin is quickly positioning itself to become the official 'tipping' currency on the internet.
						As demand continues to grow for 'tipping' functionality within social media networks, FedoraCoin offers an ideal solution.
						With a simple 'tip of the hat' FedoraCoin users can reward a constructive post or project with a coin of actual, verifiable value. 
						It's exciting to imagine what the online community will begin to use FedoraCoin for.
						Read more about this development here: <a href="https://pay.withfedoraco.in/">pay.withfedoraco.in</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						FedoraCoin differs from other virtual currencies available because it is truly a community project.
						The main development team is accessible to discuss future enhancements, along with an active community that gives ideas and support on a daily basis.
					</p>
					<p>
						FedoraCoin has been designed to be more than 'just another virtual currency'.
						It is not a joke or meme coin, fading in value as soon as it becomes unpopular.
						Rather, a large total number of coins were intentionally made available to prevent most of the currency ending up in the hands of a few individuals.
						FedoraCoin developers have focused intently on positioning TIPS to be the premiere tipping commodity on the internet.
					</p>
					<p>
						Consider Bitcoin's humble beginnings in 2009, and its role now as a multi billion dollar market capitalization behemoth - FedoraCoin is still in its infant stages but possesses enormous potential.
					</p>
					<p>Also, the yet-to-be-publicly-announced feature that will set FedoraCoin apart from other coins will be revealed shortly. Join us in the #TIPS IRC channel if you want to be one of the first to hear about this exciting development</p>
				</section>
				<section id="why_involved">
					<header>
						<h3>Can do I get involved?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						Of course, much like other virtual currencies FedoraCoin can be generated through 'mining' using commonly available computer parts.
						This allows people all over the world to take part in a decentralized economy, using coins for tipping, investing, or transferring money across the globe without paying transaction fees or dealing with banks.

					<h1>How do I get started?</h1>
				</header>
				<p>To be able to send and receive TIPS, you need the FedoraCoin wallet. The wallet is just what it sounds like: a digital version of the old leather chained wallet, except you can use it to send and receive coins, check your balance at any time and also store addresses to help make sending coins to your friends fast and easy.</p>

					<h2>1. Get the wallet</h2>
					<p>The wallet comes with a user-friendly GUI, but the true euphorics among us can also use the daemon and RPC.</p>

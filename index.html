						<h2>17 February 2014 - TiPS (FedoraCoin) releases world first coin mixing feature.</h2>
					</header>
					<p>After some weeks testing and tuning it we're finally happy to release the TiPS coin mixing service!</p>
					<p>Services can be started by (almost) anyone and allow users to anonymize their transactions, ensuring that nobody except themselves and the (trusted) mixing service know where the coins came from.</p>
					<p>In return for this service the operator receives a small bursary in the form of a fee added to the mixed transaction, giving the operator a reason to continue.</p>
					<p>The original launch announcement and changelog is available <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=391192.msg4886224#msg4886224">here on BitcoinTalk</a>, guides on how to start a mixing service will be available soon.</p>

					<h1>But why?</h1>
				</header>
				<p>Wondering why should you start using TiPS? Read on to learn more and find what makes your TiPS count.</p>
				<section id="why_what">
					<header>
						<h3>What are TiPS?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						TiPS is the symbol for FedoraCoin, an open source, anonymous virtual currency similar to Bitcoin.
						As an alternative currency TiPS uses peer-to-peer technology (where users computers connect with other users to form the network) to allow payments to be made worldwide with zero or low processing fees.
						TiPS are traded directly against the value of other digital currencies, requiring only a small conversion fee when converting to another coin.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since nobody owns or controls FedoraCoin, neither a central authority or a bank, everybody can take part.
						TiPS owners never pay bank transfer fees, allowing them to send and receiving wealth over the internet securely,anonymously, instantly and free.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="why_value">
					<header>
						<h3>What gives TiPS value?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>TiPS possess real world value for a number of different reasons:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>As in the name, TiPS are designed as tipping commodity</li>
						<li>TiPS is an ideal vessel for transferring wealth</li>
						<li>TiPS can be used as an investment (At the time of this writing, FedoraCoin is worth $3 million USD and rising)</li>
						<li>TiPS is the first online currency that allows you to send coins without leaving a trace of their origin, thanks to the world-first mixing service</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="why_difference">
					<header>
						<h3>What's so different about TiPS?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						TiPS has quickly positioned itself to become the official 'tipping' currency on the internet.
						As demand continues to grow for 'tipping' functionality within social media networks, TiPS offers the ideal solution.
						With a simple 'tip of the hat' TiPS owners can reward a constructive post or project with a coin of actual, verifiable value. 
						It's exciting to imagine what the online community will begin to use TiPS for.
						Read more about this development here: <a href="https://pay.withfedoraco.in/">pay.withfedoraco.in</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						TiPS differs from other virtual currencies available because it is truly a community project.
						The main development team is accessible to discuss future enhancements, along with an active community that gives ideas and support on a daily basis.
					</p>
					<p>
						TiPS has been designed to be more than 'just another virtual currency'.
						It is not a joke or meme coin, fading in value as soon as it becomes unpopular.
						Rather, a large total number of coins were intentionally made available to prevent most of the currency ending up in the hands of a few individuals.
						The TiPS developers have focused intently on positioning it to be the premiere tipping commodity on the internet.
					</p>
					<p>
						Consider Bitcoin's humble beginnings in 2009, and its role now as a multi billion dollar market capitalization behemoth - TiPS is still in its infant stages but possesses enormous potential.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="why_involved">
					<header>
						<h3>Can do I get involved?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						Of course, much like other virtual currencies TiPS can be generated through 'mining' using commonly available computer parts.
						This allows people all over the world to take part in a decentralized economy, using coins for tipping, investing, or transferring money across the globe without paying transaction fees or dealing with banks.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are other ways of gaining TiPS though, if others feel like they may send some TiPS your way, or you could invest yourself into TiPS and buy some from one of the many cryptocurrency exchanges.

					<h1>How do I get started?</h1>
				</header>
				<p>To be able to send and receive TiPS, you need the FedoraCoin wallet. The wallet is just what it sounds like: a digital version of the old leather chained wallet, except you can use it to send and receive coins, check your balance at any time and also store addresses to help make sending coins to your friends fast and easy.</p>
				
				<section id="how-download">
					<h2>1. Get the wallet</h2>
					<p>The wallet comes with a user-friendly GUI, but if you know how you can choose to use the daemon and RPC instead.</p>

					<h2>On Reddit</h2>
					<p>
						It couldn't be easier to TIP your Fedora at a fellow redditor. Just mention <code>+/u/fedoratips 1000 tips verify</code> in a reply to send that user 1000 TIPS.
						To learn more on how to use the Reddit tip-bot, you can read <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/fedoratips/wiki/gettingstarted">this article</a>.
						The bot is being maintained by Woof (a.k.a. <a href="http://reddit.com/u/Rbech">/u/Rbech</a>).

					<h2>On the rest of the internet</h2>
					<p>
						When you want to TIP someone on the rest of the internet, the best way to do it is to ask their FedoraCoin address.
						It's unfortunately not possible to send FedoraCoins to someone without an address yet, but we hope a lot of sites will integrate with w/ Fedoracoin in the future to allow this.
						If you're a developer and want to help out, someone <a href="http://feedback.withfedoraco.in/responses/i-would-like-to-send-someone-an-email-with-a-heading-you-have-earned-xxxx-tips">proposed a system where you could TIP over email</a>.
